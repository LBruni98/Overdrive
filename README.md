## 2. Game Overview

### 2.1 Philosophy

#### 2.1.1 Revival of Awesome Features

The game is going to revive a particular part of the genre that has not seen in most racing games, which is unlimited customizations on the cars; being able to choose whatever parts to go on whatever car. Limitless customization hasn’t been seen for a long time, the closest to this sort of customization being “The Crew 2”.

#### 2.1.2 Pure Arcade Handling

Most modern racers have to rely on handling close to realistic, mimicking the feel of actual cars in racing. While it benefits its fans well, some gamers prefer that semi-realistic or arcade feel, where the cars handle easily and quicker than what is perceived in “realistic” racing games. There has been a lack of these sorts of racers as of late, so it would be good to go back to the roots to bring players a fun experience

### 2.2 Common Questions

#### 2.2.1 What is the game?

Road Rage is a racing game where a rookie racer must make it to the top of an anything goes racing tournament, where the races are intense and chaotic, requiring the best to make it to first place.

#### 2.2.2 Why create this game?

This game is part of individual projects in Reboot games. The main aim is to create a high octane racing experience similar to that of classic racing games.

#### 2.2.3 Where does the game take place?

The game takes place in multiple locations around the world, anywhere from city race tracks, circuit tracks and dirt trials across numerous world locations.

#### 2.2.4 What do I control?

The player controls the rookie driver, once a movie stuntman. The player also drives the character’s main car, which is chosen by the player.

There are numerous cars that can be chosen by the player, all can be driven and upgradable, with such cars as estates, performance cars, sports saloons, touring cars and racing prototypes.

#### 2.2.5 What is the main focus?

The game is about a former movie stuntman, who enters the tournament after his career took a downfall. Now he must beat the all-time champion in order to get his career back as well as take the top spot as the new all-time champion, if he chooses.

#### 2.2.6 What’s different?

What Road Rage is aiming to do is to bring back the limitless type of customizations that you can make to your car and make it more suitable for a different type of race rather than just buy another car, however that is a choice too in this game.

The game features more arcade like handling, mainly to reach out to more of an audience and appeal to all sorts of gamers and not be too difficult to the point of which it is not fun.

## 3. Features in Road Rage

### 3.1 Gameplay Overview
The game will focus on fast paced gameplay for any player, which should make the game in turn able for anyone to pick up and play. There will be an arcade element or feeling to the game to make the game achieve that all-round feeling.

The player will race in each racing division, acquiring cash and using it for cars or upgrades to the cars. The campaign will allow players to race to unlock tracks, upgrade and cars, which subsequently be used for single player. The player will race against a huge grid of players, which should make each race very frantic.

### 3.2 Customization
Customization in this game will be available for all the cars in the game no matter what that car is. Each car can be modified to what the player wants regardless to create a unique racing machine, capable. Each upgrade is as followed:

•	Front Bumpers
•	Rear Bumpers
•	Side Splits
•	Hoods
•	Spoilers
•	Exhaust

In addition to this, cars will also have the ability to upgrade the performance, with engine, chassis, suspension, tires and nitrous. These upgrades will give the car added acceleration, speed, grip and handling, through 3-5 levels depending on the type of car due to the base performance and class. Nitrous allows players at the press of a button to give their car a burst of acceleration, again depending on the level; a low level nitrous system will only offer a quick burst whereas high level nitro will offer a longer, much powerful burst as well as go over the car’s top speed.

### 3.3 Race Types
There are many different race types that will be available in Road Rage, each with their own objectives to complete the race. The player can choose to play:

#### 3.3.1 Circuit Racing
The most simple and recognized form of racing. Drivers race around a looped track which can vary depending on player choice to a number of laps. The driver wins if they have completed the maximum number of laps and crossed the finish line first.

Players can also finish in any podium position (second or third place), they can progress the game if they have finished in this position, but the rewards won’t be as that of first place.

#### 3.3.2 Sprint Race
Same as circuit racing but rather than racing in a number of laps, players simply must race from point A to point B. The player can still finish first, second or third.

#### 3.3.3 Drag Race
A drag race will be set on a straight-line track, where a number of drivers must get to the end first to win. This mode is almost similar to that of a sprint race, but players are forced to use manual transmission, which is where this mode shines. To be the fastest, players must time their shifts perfectly in order to come out on top, but if the player misses a shift, over-revs or short shifts, then the player can lose time.

This mode will have a tutorial dialogue box for any new players on their first race.
